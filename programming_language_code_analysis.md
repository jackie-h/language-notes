Semmle


Treesitter - Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited

coAST is a universal abstract syntax tree that allows to easily analyze each programming language
https://github.com/coala/coAST
Not bidirectional

Tools that are bi-directional 
http://www.augeas.net (config)

Byte-code level transformations - if programs compile to byte code can do analysis there on similarity
E.g. LLVM
Requires code to compile, Not bidirectional

What can we do with them ?

Duplication Detection across languages
Code complexity metrics
Single models for code completion - applicable across all languages 

Deep learning - need to adapt models for trees, to do more accurate deep learning
