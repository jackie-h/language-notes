Source Code Analyzers
---------------------
https://github.com/github/semantic - semantic is a Haskell library and command line tool for parsing, analyzing, and comparing source code.

Semmle: https://semmle.com/

Kythe (google):
https://kythe.io/
The Kythe project was founded to provide and support tools and standards that encourage interoperability among programs that manipulate source code. At a high level, the main goal of Kythe is to provide a standard, language-agnostic interchange mechanism, allowing tools that operate on source code — including build systems, compilers, interpreters, static analyses, editors, code-review applications, and more — to share information with each other smoothly.

Treesitter - Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited

coAST is a universal abstract syntax tree that allows to easily analyze each programming language

Not bidirectional

Tools that are bi-directional

Byte-code level transformations - if programs compile to byte code can do analysis there on similarity
E.g. LLVM
Requires code to compile, Not bidirectional

What can we do with them ?
-----


Duplication Detection across languages
Code complexity metrics
Single models for code completion - applicable across all languages 

Deep learning - need to adapt models for trees, to do more accurate deep learning
